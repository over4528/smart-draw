- **Excalidraw**: Beautiful & Creative - Ideal for brainstorming sessions, creative designs, and presentations with a hand-drawn style

### 📊 Rich Chart Types
Supports 20+ chart types, including flowcharts, architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, ER diagrams, mind maps, network topology diagrams, Gantt charts, and more. AI can also automatically select the most suitable chart type based on your description.

### 🎨 Perfect Editor Integration
Generated charts are fully based on Draw.io or Excalidraw format, allowing free editing, style adjustments, and detail additions on the canvas—achieving the perfect combination of AI generation and manual refinement.

### ⚡ Ready to Use
Simply configure an AI API key to get started, no complex environment setup required. All configurations are stored locally in your browser for privacy and security.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Configure AI Service

#### Option 1: Use Access Password

If the server administrator has configured an access password, you can directly use the server-side LLM configuration without providing your own API Key:

1. Click the **"Access Password"** button in the top right corner
2. Enter the access password provided by the administrator
3. Click **"Validate Password"** to test the connection
4. Check **"Enable Access Password"** and save

Once enabled, the application will prioritize the server-side configuration, and you can start creating without configuring your own API Key!

#### Option 2: Configure Your Own AI

1. Click the **"Configure LLM"** button in the top right corner
2. Select provider type (OpenAI or Anthropic)
3. Enter your API Key
4. Select model (**Highly recommend claude-sonnet-4.5** for best results)
5. Save configuration

That's it! You're ready to start creating.

### Step 2: Choose Drawing Engine

After accessing the application, you can choose between two drawing engines:

- **Draw.io** (`/drawio`): Perfect for creating precise, professional structured diagrams
- **Excalidraw** (`/excalidraw`): Perfect for creating hand-drawn style creative diagrams

### Step 3: Create Charts

Describe your needs in natural language in the input box, for example:
- "Draw a user login flowchart"
- "Create a microservices architecture diagram including gateway, authentication service, and business services"
- "Design a database ER diagram for an e-commerce system"

AI will automatically generate the chart, which you can directly edit and adjust on the canvas.

## 💻 Local Deployment

If you want to run the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/liujuntao123/smart-excalidraw-next.git
cd smart-excalidraw-next

# Install dependencies (this project uses pnpm)
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to start using.

### Configure Server-Side LLM (Optional)

If you want to provide a unified LLM configuration for users and avoid requiring them to obtain their own API Keys, you can configure the server-side access password feature:

1. Copy the environment variables example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure the following variables in `.env`:
```bash
# Access password (users need to enter this password to use server-side LLM)
ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

# LLM provider type (openai or anthropic)
SERVER_LLM_TYPE=anthropic

# API base URL
SERVER_LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1

# API key
SERVER_LLM_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Model name
SERVER_LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

3. Restart the development server, and users can use the server-configured LLM through the access password.

**Benefits:**
- Users don't need to apply for and configure their own API Keys
- Centralized management of API usage and costs
- Suitable for team or organizational internal use
- Provide free trial experience to users

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions
